## What Changed

### 1. Exit Model — Split-Exit (Open Run → TP1 + Runner)

The model previously ran all trades to EOD with no take-profit. It now uses a **split-exit**:

| Leg | Size | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| TP1 | 50% | 0.10% (10 bps) in trade's favour |
| Runner | 50% | Stop moves to **breakeven** (entry) after TP1; holds to structural stop or 16:00 ET |

**If TP1 is never reached** — full position exits at the structural stop (−1R, same as before).

**Exit labels:**
- `WIN` — TP1 was hit (runner may close at BE or EOD)
- `LOSS` — structural stop hit before TP1

**Results (NQ, all history — 2,717 trades):**

| | |
|---|---|
| TP1 hit rate | **56.0%** |
| Avg win | **+$127.54** |
| Avg loss | **−$224.37** |

### 2. MFE Study — PhD-Level Analysis

Full distributional study on Max Favourable Excursion across all resolved trades.

**Key stats:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean MFE | 0.3798% |
| Median MFE | 0.1574% |
| Mode MFE | 0.0758% |
| Std Dev | 0.5882% |
| Skewness | 5.45 (heavy right tail) |
| Log-normal goodness (r) | 0.9825 |

**Natural clusters (p33 / p75 breakpoints):**

| Cluster | Range | Trades | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | 0 – 0.0979% | 897 | 33% |
| Moderate | 0.0979% – 0.4283% | 1,140 | 42% |
| Large | 0.4283%+ | 680 | 25% |

**Breakeven (Protect the Queen) analysis:**

Each MFE trigger level was evaluated for: reach rate, P(positive exit | MFE ≥ X), trades rescued, and EV improvement.

> **Recommended PTQ level: 0.2965%**
> Reached by 33% of trades. Once hit, 50.2% exit positively — the earliest trigger where odds flip in your favour. Moving to BE here saves ~447 trades from negative exits and improves EV by +0.1615R per trade.

### 3. MAE Study — PhD-Level Analysis

Full distributional study on Max Adverse Excursion across all resolved trades.

**Key stats:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean MAE | 0.1698% |
| Median MAE | 0.1427% |
| Mode MAE | 0.1310% |
| Std Dev | 0.1311% |
| Skewness | 10.34 (heavy right tail) |
| Log-normal goodness (r) | 0.9615 |

**Natural clusters (p33 / p75 breakpoints):**

| Cluster | Range | Trades | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tight | 0 – 0.1111% | 897 | 33% |
| Moderate | 0.1111% – 0.2102% | 1,139 | 42% |
| Wide | 0.2102%+ | 681 | 25% |

**SL sweep analysis:**

For each MAE level tested, the sweep measures P(false stop) — trades that touch the level but still recover to hit TP1. Across all 12 levels tested:

> **P(false stop) never drops below 32%** — even at the widest SL tested (0.3646%), 67.6% of touched trades still recover.
> **Conclusion: the structural stop is the natural boundary.** Any fixed % SL tighter than the structural stop cuts a large proportion of legitimate winners.

### 5. Tab Navigation

The single long-scroll page has been replaced with a **5-tab layout**:

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| Overview | Hero stats · How It Works |
| Performance | Direction split · DOW/Hour charts · Quarter · Year table · Month chart · Equity curve |

| Trades | Last 40 trades log |

- Tab buttons sit in the sticky nav bar — no page scrolling required
- Switching tabs scrolls to top and re-renders any canvases that need sizing
- Timeframe selector stays visible across all tabs
