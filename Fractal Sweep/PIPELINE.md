# Fractal Sweep Pipeline — Complete Architecture

**Last updated:** 2026-04-15

---

## Overview

Statistical backtesting engine for NQ and ES micro futures. Detects fractal sweep + CISD setups across 15 years of 1-minute data, validates with walk-forward regime analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and cross-instrument SMT divergence — then displays results in an interactive probability dashboard.

**Stack:** Python 3.14 · DuckDB 1.4.4 · pandas · numpy · standalone HTML (zero CDN deps)

## Database

**File:** `candle_science.duckdb` (gitignored, ~2GB)

| Table | Schema |
|-------|--------|
| `nq_1m` | `timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ, open/high/low/close DOUBLE, volume BIGINT` |
| `es_1m` | Same schema |

Timestamps stored as `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` (America/Toronto). Always convert: `timezone('America/New_York', timestamp)`.

---

## The 4 Sweep Models

| Key | Sweep TF | CISD TF |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `4H_15M` | 4 Hour | 15 Min |
| `1H_5M` | 1 Hour | 5 Min |
| `1H_3M` | 1 Hour | 3 Min |
| `30M_3M` | 30 Min | 3 Min |

**Constants:** `SWEEP_MAX_PCT = 0.50` (now a runtime-toggleable reference) · `MIN_RISK_PTS = 3.0` · `MAX_RISK_PTS = 112.5` · `CISD_FAST_BARS = None` (unlimited)

**Removed (2026-04-15):** The `min_range` parameter (F1 filter). Data showed it was rejecting above-average trades on every timeframe. See commit `62eda17`. The `q1_min` window gate was also removed — sweeps are detected across the full HTF period.

---

## Setup Detection (3 Phases)

### Phase 1 — Sweep
Price breaks beyond the prior HTF candle's high or low at any point within the HTF period (no Q1 gate). Sweep ≤50% of prior range is tagged as F3-passing; deeper sweeps are tagged and kept for runtime filtering. Sweep extreme (lowest low for long, highest high for short) locked at detection.

### Phase 2 — Return to Range
Price closes back inside the prior candle's range. No deadline — can happen anytime within the HTF period. Failures are tagged F4 and kept for runtime filtering.

### Phase 3 — CISD
Backward scan from the return bar finds the consecutive opposing delivery run. CISD level = open of the earliest candle in that run. Fires when current close crosses through CISD level. Dojis skipped, no bar limit.

**Entry:** Next CISD-TF candle open (backtest) · Current bar close (indicator)

---

## Risk Profiles (`RR_PROFILES` in `engine/model_stats.py`)

| Key | profile_type | Stop / Target |
|---|---|---|
| `simple_1r` | `mult` | SL = sweep extreme (1× base_risk); TP = 1R (100% exit) |
| `raw_measure` | `raw` | No SL/TP — records full-session MAE/MFE only, `outcome='MEASURED'` |

`simple_1r` drives the win/loss dashboard. `raw_measure` is measurement-only for MAE/MFE distribution studies.

---

## Runtime Filters (6, dashboard-toggleable)

Two groups render in a dedicated filter bar below the Period/TF/Profile dropdowns. Each chip shows a live `±N` badge indicating how many trades would be added or removed if that single chip were toggled, so users can see the impact before clicking.

**Setup Quality** (default ON, uncheck to relax — amber highlight)

| Chip | Code | What it requires |
|---|---|---|
| Shallow Sweep | `F3_SWEEP_TOO_LARGE` | `sweep_ext / ref_range ≤ 0.50` |
| Closed Back Inside | `F4_NO_CLOSE_BACK` | `ret_close` is inside the prior candle's range |

**Add Confirmation** (default OFF, check to narrow — purple highlight)

| Chip | Column | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| NQ-ES Divergence | `smt` | NQ swept its prior level but ES did not sweep its corresponding level |
| Hour Open Aligned | `cisd_aligned` | LONG: CISD close > current hour open · SHORT: CISD close < current hour open |
| Prior Bar Counters | `prior_counter_close` | LONG: prior sweep-TF bar closed bearish · SHORT: prior bar closed bullish |
| Prior Bar Engulfs | `prior_engulfing` | Prior sweep-TF bar's range contains the previous bar's range (wick-inclusive) |

**Combinatorics.** `compute_filter_variants()` enumerates 2⁶ = 64 combinations per model × profile, sorted by EV, rendered in the Filters tab.

**SMT backtest.** Loads `es_1m` alongside `nq_1m`, builds ES sweep-TF candles, checks the ES window at NQ sweep detection time. Pine indicator uses 10 ES security calls.

**Toggle scope.** Filters work on every Period selection (All Time + 2y/1y/6m/3m/1m). `_compute_by_tf` builds `recent_trades` for each sub-slice from `wl_full` (which includes F3/F4-rejected trades), so toggling a rejection filter off on e.g. Last 3 Months restores the F-rejected trades that fell inside that 3-month window.

**Removed filter.** F1 (min prior range) was removed entirely on 2026-04-15. On every timeframe, removing F1 both increased trade count **and** improved WR — the filter was rejecting above-average trades.

---

## Over-Risk Handling

Setups where `risk_pts > MAX_RISK_PTS (112.5)` are detected but treated differently:

- **Backtest:** Resolved but marked `rejected_by = 'RISK_TOO_LARGE'`
- **Indicator:** Drawn with orange dashed lines, red/teal R:R boxes, "OVER RISK X pts" badge. No alert fired

---

## MAE/MFE & Hourly Normalization

- `mae_pct` / `mfe_pct` — as % of entry price
- `mae_pct_hr` / `mfe_pct_hr` — as % of entry hour's range (regime-independent)
- `hour_range_pts` = high − low of all 1m bars in the trade's (date, hour)

### Recommendation Logic
- **PTQ:** Highest reach_rate where P(positive exit | MFE ≥ X) ≥ 0.70, fallback 0.50
- **opt_sl:** Tightest MAE where P(genuine loss | MAE ≥ X) ≥ 0.70, fallback 0.50

---

## Walk-Forward Regime Analysis

Client-side in `model_dashboard.html`. User defines consecutive date ranges.

1. **Train period:** Derive MAE stop variants (max, p90, p85, p50) + MFE targets (PTQ, p50)
2. **Test period:** Re-resolve trades with each train-derived stop cap
3. **5 stop variants tested:** Structural, Max MAE, P90 MAE, P85 MAE, P50 MAE
4. **Overfitting score:** Test EV / Train EV × 100 — ≥80% = ROBUST, 60-80% = MILD DECAY, <60% = OVERFIT
5. **Best variant:** Lowest CV across pairs (most regime-stable)
6. **Rolling pairs:** R1→R2, R2→R3, R3→R4

## Advanced Analysis (Custom Ranges View)

### Monte Carlo Simulation (N=1,000)
- Shuffles actual R values, builds equity curves per ordering
- **Equity fan chart:** p5/p25/p50/p75/p95 confidence bands + actual curve
- **Ruin probability:** P(account ≤ $0)
- **Bootstrap 95% CI** for final equity, WR, EV
- **Max DD distribution:** histogram with p50/p95/actual markers

### Rolling Stability (50-trade window)
- Rolling WR, EV, PF time series with mean reference lines
- **CUSUM chart:** Cumulative performance deviation — upslope = edge active, downslope = degrading

### Feature Attribution
- WR/EV/PF by feature bucket: session, direction, DOW, SMT, classification, sweep %, risk pts
- Sorted by EV with delta-vs-baseline and visual edge bars
- **Hour × Direction conditional EV heatmap** (green/red intensity)

### Distribution Shift Tests (Train vs Test)
- **Wasserstein distance** (earth mover's) for MAE, MFE, R distributions
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** at 95% confidence: PASS/REJECT
- Per-pair verdict: STABLE / MILD SHIFT / REGIME CHANGE

### Regime Analysis
- Rolling 20-trade window classification: Low Vol, High Vol, Trending, Choppy
- Performance cards per regime (WR/EV/PF)
- **Regime transition matrix** — P(next regime | current regime)
- Regime timeline canvas (bars colored by regime, y = R outcome)

### Stress Testing
- **WR degradation table:** 5% decrements from actual WR, showing EV/PF/DD/ruin/viability
- **Adverse streak probability:** 3L through 10L — P(streak), expected occurrences, account survival

## Pine Indicator

Lives in `Fractal Sweep/pine/fractal_sweep.pine` (indicator) and `pine/fractal_sweep_strategy.pine` (strategy version). Auto-detects chart TF → maps to sweep/CISD combo. Draws sweep lines, CISD lines, R:R boxes, T-Spot zones, SMT labels, over-risk badges.

### Visual Hierarchy
| Setup Type | Lines | Boxes | Badge |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Q1 valid** | Solid red/blue, width 2 | Red risk + teal reward | — |
| **Non-Q1 valid** | Solid orange/amber, width 2 | Dark red + amber | `*` suffix |
| **Over-risk** | Dashed orange, width 1 | Light red + light teal | OVER RISK X pts |
| **Pending** | Dashed, 75% opacity, width 1 | — | — |
