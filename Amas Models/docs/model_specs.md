## Glossary

_Every term the mentor uses, defined once. Models reference glossary terms instead of redefining them. Each entry cites the first source where the term is introduced or best defined._

- **H1 candle** — A 1-hour candle. Per the mentor: "every 59 and 59 seconds, the H1 candle will close. Boom. New one will open." (M1 PDF 35:02). The framework tracks H1 closes and trades the *transition* between one H1 close and the next H1 open.
- **Draw / Draw on liquidity / Target** — The price level the mentor expects price to "be drawn to" within the next H1 window. For Continuation, it's the prior H1's already-formed high (long) or low (short). For Reversal, it's the opposite extreme of the swept range. (M1 PDF 24:10, "I know price will most likely go towards this high")
- **Continuation pattern** — H1 candle closes *above* the previous H1's high (bullish) or *below* the previous H1's low (bearish). Mentor's claim: "80% chance of seeing a candle close on the H1 and see open high into that H1 candle here." (M1 PDF 01:29)
- **Reversal pattern** — H1 candle *sweeps* the previous H1's high or low (price wicks past it) but *closes back inside* the prior H1's range. After a high sweep that closes back inside, the *low* of the prior H1 becomes the draw; symmetrically for low sweeps. (M1 PDF 23:50, "we swept previous candles low, close back inside the range. So, what do I know? I know this high is going to be taken up 80% of the time.")
- **Sweep / Liquidity sweep** — Price wicks beyond a high or low without closing past it. The wick takes out resting orders ("liquidity") sitting at that level.
- **Macro / Macro window** — The mentor's term for specific 20-minute windows where macros (algorithmic moves) tend to fire. The H1-internal macro is the **last 10 + first 10 minutes around an hourly close** (`:50–:10`). There are also session-specific macros (e.g., `:50–:10` of the 9 AM hour = `08:50–09:10` ET, called "9:50–10:10 macro"). (M1 PDF 03:43, M1 PDF 1:00:03)
- **First 10 / Last 10** — Shorthand for the two halves of the H1-internal macro window: last 10 minutes of the prior H1 (`:50–:00`) and first 10 minutes of the new H1 (`:00–:10`). (M1 PDF 07:02, "the first portion of the macros to the last 10 minutes of the hour, okay? Which means that it's from 50 to 0 first.")
- **":42 timing rule"** — The high or low you are *targeting* must have been *formed* at or after minute :42 of the source H1 candle. Highs/lows formed before :42 are typically rejected by the mentor as low-probability. (M1 PDF 49:26, "you always want the high or the low you're trying to target to be formed after 42.")
- **CISD** — _(not used by Amas mentor; this is Fractal Sweep terminology — see cross-cutting concepts.)_
- **Order Block (OB)** — An M1 candlestick pattern: price breaks structure (high/low/higher-high), and the *zone* of the candle that broke structure is the order block. A bullish OB forms after price breaks structure to the upside; a bearish OB after a break to the downside. The mentor enters in this zone on the pullback. (M1 PDF 26:18, M2 PDF 1:03:48)
- **Breaker Block** — A *failed* order block: an order block that gets violated (price closes through it) and then re-tests it from the opposite side. "When you disrespect a bullish order block, it turns into a bearish breaker." (M1 PDF 29:21)
- **Inversion FVG / Inversion for Value Gap** — A Fair Value Gap that gets traded through and then re-tests in the opposite role: a bearish FVG that's broken above becomes bullish support on retest. (M1 PDF 29:31, "this is my favorite entry model and by far the best in trading.")
- **Fair Value Gap (FVG) / Value Gap** — A 3-candle imbalance where the middle candle's body fully crosses the gap between the high of bar 1 and the low of bar 3 (bullish) or vice versa.
- **Market Structure Shift (MSS) / Break of Structure (BOS)** — A change in trend on a small timeframe: price makes a lower-low after a high (bearish MSS) or higher-high after a low (bullish MSS). The mentor uses this on M1 to time entries.
- **Fake Market Structure Shift** — When M1 makes an MSS that the mentor expects to fail because the higher-timeframe (H1) bias is opposite. He waits for this fake shift and trades against it. (M1 PDF 17:11)
- **Opposite structure** — On the H1, when there is an obvious S/R level (prior order block, FVG, big wick) inside the H1 candle's range that would *resist* the draw move. Mentor scratches setups where opposite structure is "blatant"; takes them when it's mild and the M1 setup is otherwise strong. (M1 PDF 38:16, M2 PDF 51:55)
- **Rejection of HTF liquidity** — When the H1 wick has *already* taken out a higher-timeframe (H4 or daily) high/low. The mentor avoids fading that — he interprets the prior wick as having already swept the liquidity, so the move into the prior H1 high is less likely to repeat. (M1 PDF 37:08)
- **Aggressive candle / Volume in the body** — A signed close where the H1 body (open→close) is large relative to the wick(s). Mentor avoids dojis and slim-body H1s; he wants "the body to have volume in it." (M1 PDF 47:18)
- **Distribution candle** — An H1 candle whose extreme (the low for a bearish candle, the high for a bullish candle) is formed *late* in the candle's lifetime. For a bearish distribution candle: opens, makes the high, distributes downward, makes the low near the close (OHLC sequence: open-high-low-close). The low is "unprotected" — there's not enough remaining time in the candle for buyers to step in and form a defensible OB. **Tradeable.** (M3 transcript 08:05, 11:24)
- **Pullback candle** — An H1 candle whose extreme is formed *early* in the candle's lifetime. For a bearish pullback candle: opens, makes the low quickly, then retraces high, then closes back lower (OHLC sequence: open-low-high-close). The low is "protected" — there's been enough time in the candle for buyers to defensively load up at the low, forming a high-probability OB that resists being swept. **NOT tradeable** by the mentor. (M3 transcript 09:11, 09:36)
- **Protected vs Unprotected low/high** — The same idea as Distribution vs Pullback, framed from the structure side: an unprotected low (in a bearish candle) is the kind formed near the close; a protected low is formed early and "had time to be defended." The :42 rule operationalizes the boundary. (M3 transcript 10:36)
- **Displacement** — A large H1 candle (in points) whose body and volume substantially exceed the prior N candles. Indicates strong directional conviction; mentor sometimes overrides his other rules when displacement is extreme ("I will never disrespect the rule of 42... but if the volume is huge enough I will hold past 1R"). (M3 transcript 26:31, 27:17)
- **V-signature** — An M1 entry pattern: a 3-bar sequence where bar 1 makes a low, bar 2 wicks lower (sweep), bar 3 closes back up sharply. Forms a "V" shape. Mentor prefers this entry over waiting for an OB-then-pullback when displacement is present. (M3 transcript 1:11:28)
- **5-criteria validation list (M3 explicit)** — The mentor enumerates the criteria for an A+ trade in a single drill (M3 03:06): (1) no rejection of higher timeframe liquidity; (2) no opposite structure; (3) no lunch macro; (4) no big wicks (i.e., big volume candle, aggressive body); (5) low/high formed after :42 (i.e., distribution not pullback); (6) no SMTs. He counts these as "5 criteria" but actually lists 6–7. The engine treats each as a separate `passes_*` flag.
- **A+ setup** — Mentor's tag for a setup that meets *all* validation criteria: no opposite structure, no HTF liquidity rejection, aggressive H1 body, target high/low formed after :42, M1 has a clean OB / Breaker / Inversion-FVG, and timing is tight to the H1 close. (M2 PDF 11:15, M2 PDF 18:18)
- **SMT / NQ-ES Divergence** — When NQ takes out its target liquidity but ES does not, OR ES does and NQ doesn't. The mentor uses SMT both for entry confirmation (when no clean sweep exists) and for stop-management ("SMT is a reason why you should either put your stops to break even or get the fuck out"). (M1 PDF 1:07:23, M2 PDF 07:39)
- **Drop / Jaw / Slope** — Casual mentor synonyms for the prior H1's high (or low) — i.e., the draw. ("This slope has 80% chance of being taken out.")
- **PDR / PDA / PDA rate** — Premium-Discount Region / Premium-Discount Array. ICT-derived terminology for the price zone where a setup is valid. Mentor uses "PDR" loosely to mean "pullback zone for entry."

## Cross-cutting concepts

_Rules, filters, and definitions that apply to multiple models._

### Anchor and time

- **Anchor unit:** the H1 candle. All detection logic is keyed off the H1 close timestamp.
- **Timezone:** all timestamps in `America/New_York`. The mentor explicitly clocks his 9:50/10:10/11:10/etc. macros in NY time (M1 PDF 1:00:08 references the 9:50–10:10 window as primary).
- **Macro windows (preferred trading times):** the mentor ranks NY macros by his preference. From M1 PDF 1:01:41:
  1. **`09:50–10:10`** — best
  2. `10:50–11:10`
  3. `08:50–09:10`
  4. `12:50–13:10` ("good but hard")
  5. `13:50–14:10` ("the one I have a love-hate relationship with")
  6. `14:50–15:10`
  7. **`11:50–12:10` — explicitly avoid** ("no liquidity at all")
- **Outside macros:** trades fired outside `:50–:10` are **lower probability** but not strictly rejected. Mentor: "everything that is not immediate is lower probability. I would probably not take that." (M1 PDF 22:33)
- **":42 timing rule":** for any setup, the H1 high (long) or low (short) being targeted must have been formed at or after minute `:42` of its source H1 candle. Highs/lows formed earlier in the candle are anti-edge — they correspond to "open low, low formed early, push up, close" style distributions where the mentor's model decays. (M1 PDF 49:26, 50:38, 51:11, 51:53)

### Risk and sizing

- **Per-trade risk:** $400 USD on NQ mini ($20/pt) — implies max 20-point stop (per design spec). For wider stops (the mentor cites 32-handle stops as the boundary), switch to micros — the engine treats this as the same setup with the same R; only dollar size changes.
- **Stop placement:** at the nearest *trade-invalidation* level — typically the swing high above (for shorts) / swing low below (for longs) of the M1 entry pattern. "If price goes there, it will be invalidating your trade." (M1 PDF 1:15:02)
- **Target:** **1R (1:1)** is the headline. Mentor: "Target a one-to-one. Most of the time, it will be either 1 to 1 or 0.9 to 1, close to negative RR most of the time." (M1 PDF 15:58). On A+ setups he sometimes "swings" for 2R+, but the engine's default is `simple_1r`.
- **MAX_RISK_PTS = 20.0** — risk gate (design spec).
- **MIN_RISK_PTS = None** — no lower floor (design spec).

### Confluences (filters that apply across models)

Each becomes a `passes_<key>: bool` flag on every trade row.

- **`passes_macro_010` (key: `MACRO`)** — entry timestamp falls within `:50–:10` of any hour. Always-on baseline expectation per mentor; surfaced as toggleable to measure standalone edge.
- **`passes_top3_macros` (key: `MACRO_TOP3`)** — entry within one of the 3 best windows: `08:50–09:10`, `09:50–10:10`, `10:50–11:10`.
- **`passes_avoid_lunch` (key: `NO_LUNCH`)** — entry NOT within `11:50–12:10` (the explicitly-avoided window). Independent of `MACRO_TOP3` so we can measure it standalone.
- **`passes_target_after_42` (key: `T42`)** — the prior H1's high/low being targeted was formed at minute ≥42 of its candle. Computed by scanning the prior H1's 1m bars for the high/low timestamp.
- **`passes_no_opposite_struct_h1` (key: `NO_OS`)** — the H1 candle whose close triggers the setup has no large opposite-structure feature inside it (large opposite-side wick > a threshold of the body, or a clean opposite OB on the H1). _Initial threshold TBD; see Open Questions._
- **`passes_no_htf_rejection` (key: `NO_HTF_REJ`)** — the H1 wick (in the trade direction) has not already taken out an H4 or daily high/low. _Implementation: requires H4 and daily series — derived by resampling 1m bars._
- **`passes_aggressive_body` (key: `AGG_BODY`)** — the H1 body (`abs(close - open)`) is at least N% of the candle range (`high - low`). _Initial threshold: body ≥ 60% of range._
- **`passes_distribution_candle` (key: `DIST`)** — the H1 candle is a *distribution* candle (extreme formed late, ≥:42), not a *pullback* candle (extreme formed early, <:42). Implementation: scan the H1's 1m bars; find the timestamp of the candle's relevant extreme (low for bearish, high for bullish); flag passes if `extreme_minute >= 42`. This is *the same signal* as `passes_target_after_42` for the *self*-candle (the just-closed H1). For the prior H1 (the candle whose draw is being targeted), the analogous flag is `passes_target_after_42` already defined above. **Two separate flags with different semantics:** `T42` is about the prior H1 (the draw); `DIST` is about the just-closed H1 (the source). Both must pass for full A+. (M3 transcript 03:06–05:06, 09:36, 10:36, 14:51)
- **`passes_smt` (key: `SMT`)** — at the moment of detection, NQ swept its draw level but ES did NOT (for shorts looking for re-test; symmetric for longs). Same primitive used by Fractal Sweep.

The first three (`MACRO`, `MACRO_TOP3`, `NO_LUNCH`) are time-of-day based. The next four are H1-feature based. `SMT` requires both instruments loaded.

### Direction and validation

- **Continuation trade direction:** same direction as the H1 close (close > prior_high → long; close < prior_low → short).
- **Reversal trade direction:** opposite the wick direction (sweep prior high then close back inside → short; sweep prior low then close back inside → long).
- **Validation criteria** (mentor lists 4, M1 PDF 36:30 onward; these become the H1-feature filters listed above):
  1. **No rejection of HTF liquidity** in the wick direction. → `passes_no_htf_rejection`.
  2. **No opposite structure** inside the H1 candle. → `passes_no_opposite_struct_h1`.
  3. **No lunch trades** (`11:50–12:10`). → `passes_avoid_lunch`.
  4. **Aggressive candle closure** with volume in the body (no doji). → `passes_aggressive_body`.
- **Discard:** if these criteria are violated, the mentor "scratches the trade" — but his decision is judgmental ("opposite structure could still work"). The engine surfaces all setups and lets each filter combo measure its standalone edge.

### Trade construction (used by both Continuation and Reversal)

The setup that fires after H1 close (or pre-positions before close) is identical in mechanics:

1. **Anchor:** the H1 candle that just closed at time T.
2. **Pattern check:** Continuation or Reversal pattern (defined per-model).
3. **Validation gates:** all four validation criteria evaluated; setup is *recorded* regardless, with `passes_*` flags.
4. **Direction:** derived per-pattern (see above).
5. **Draw:** the prior H1's relevant extreme (Continuation: prior H1's same-direction extreme; Reversal: prior H1's opposite extreme).
6. **M1 entry trigger:** the first of OB / Breaker / Inversion-FVG to form on M1 in the macro window after T (`T+0:00–T+0:10`) AND/OR before T (`T-0:10–T+0:00`, the "pre-close entry").
7. **Entry price:** the high/low of the M1 trigger pattern, on the pullback into it (the mentor uses limit orders at the pattern's edge).
8. **Stop loss:** the structural high/low immediately beyond the trigger pattern (for shorts, the swing high that the trigger broke; for longs, the swing low).
9. **Take profit:** **1R** (`simple_1r` profile) — fixed at `entry + 1 * abs(entry - SL)` for longs, mirrored for shorts.
10. **Invalidation:** if the draw is hit before the 1R, that's a TP. If SL is hit, SL. If neither resolves within `OUTCOME_MAX_BARS` (1440 minutes), `EXPIRED`.

### Pre-close vs post-close entries

The mentor describes **two distinct entry modes**:
- **Pre-close (positioning before T):** during `T-0:10–T:00` (last-10 macro), if M1 already shows the OB/Breaker/Inversion pattern AND we project the H1 will close in the right pattern, enter early. This is the "premature" entry.
- **Post-close (positioning after T):** during `T:00–T+0:10` (first-10 macro), wait for the H1 to actually close in the pattern, then look for the M1 trigger.

Mentor on safety: "the closer you are from the close, the more chances you have to win. That's 100%." (M2 PDF 09:15) "My trades, the time that I would take a trade basically, the most premature is like 52, 53." (M2 PDF 03:29)

**Engine treatment:** for v1, fire the setup at H1 close (post-close entry only). Pre-close entry adds complexity (forecasting H1 close from incomplete bar) that's better deferred. Captured as TBD #2 in Open Questions.

# Models

## Model: H1 Continuation

### Source citations
- Mentorship 1 PDF (summary) p.1 ("Continuation pattern indicates H1 candle closing above the previous candle's high. Post-close outcome probability of taking out the upwick is 80%.")
- Mentorship 1 (1).pdf [transcript] timestamps 00:52, 01:11, 01:29, 03:06, 13:04 (bearish), 21:02

### Plain-English description
After an H1 candle closes outside the prior H1's range (above the prior high → bullish; below the prior low → bearish), the mentor expects the *prior H1's same-side extreme* to be retested ("popped") within the next H1 window with ~80% probability. The trade enters on a pullback to an M1 OB/Breaker/Inversion-FVG inside the macro window around the close, targets 1R, stop above (short) / below (long) the M1 swing.

### Anchor / setup timeframe
H1 (1-hour candle, NY tz). The setup fires at H1 close at time `T`.

### Detection rules (all must be true)
1. The just-closed H1 candle's close is strictly outside the prior H1's range:
   - Bullish continuation: `H1[T].close > H1[T-1h].high`
   - Bearish continuation: `H1[T].close < H1[T-1h].low`
2. The prior H1 (`H1[T-1h]`) exists (i.e., not the first candle in the series).
3. The prior H1's relevant extreme (for the draw) is a strictly defined level: prior H1's high (bullish) or low (bearish).
4. After the close at T, the M1 bars in the post-close macro window (`T:00 – T+0:10`) contain at least one Order Block / Breaker / Inversion-FVG pattern in the trade direction. _Pattern detectors detailed below._
5. The trigger M1 pattern's invalidation level (its swing high for shorts, swing low for longs) is at most `MAX_RISK_PTS = 20.0` points from the entry price. Setups exceeding the gate are excluded entirely (not just flagged).

### Entry trigger
The first M1 Order Block / Breaker / Inversion-FVG pattern in the trade direction that forms within `[T:00, T+0:10]` and provides a pullback entry. Entry is at the pattern's edge on the pullback (limit-order semantics).

For v1, the engine operationalizes "pattern formed" as:
- **Order Block:** a 1-candle (M1) opposite-color candle that gets immediately broken by structure (a higher high after it for bullish trades; lower low for bearish). Entry = the OB candle's open (for bullish OB) or close (for bearish OB) — TBD; see Open Questions #3.
- **Breaker:** a *failed* opposite-direction OB. Detection: the M1 forms an OB in the opposite direction, then closes through it; the broken OB level becomes the trigger. Entry = the broken OB's edge.
- **Inversion FVG:** a 3-bar M1 FVG that gets traded through; on retest from the opposite side, entry at the gap edge.

Of the three, mentor prefers Inversion FVG ("by far the best in trading", M1 PDF 29:31). For v1, all three are detected and an `entry_pattern: str` field on the trade row records which one fired. A model variant restricting to Inversion-FVG only is a Phase 5 filter experiment.

### Stop loss
- **Bullish:** the swing low of the M1 trigger pattern (i.e., the lowest low of the M1 bars from the macro start through the entry bar).
- **Bearish:** the swing high of the M1 trigger pattern (highest high in the same window).

In code: stop = `min(M1 lows in [T:00, entry_ts])` for longs; mirrored for shorts. _Refinement TBD; see Open Questions #4._

### Take profit / exit
**1R** (`simple_1r` profile):
- Bullish: `tp = entry + (entry - sl)`
- Bearish: `tp = entry - (sl - entry)`

The mentor's "draw" (prior H1 extreme) is the *aspirational* target but the booked exit is 1R, which empirically tends to land at or near the draw given typical M1 entry distances.

### Direction logic
- `H1[T].close > H1[T-1h].high` → long
- `H1[T].close < H1[T-1h].low` → short

A single anchor produces at most one direction (the close is either above the prior high or below the prior low; both being true is impossible).

### Invalidation / discard
- If no qualifying M1 trigger fires within the post-close macro window `[T:00, T+0:10]`, the setup is discarded (no trade row).
- If a trigger fires but the implied risk exceeds `MAX_RISK_PTS`, the setup is discarded.
- After entry, standard outcome resolution: TP, SL, or EXPIRED at `OUTCOME_MAX_BARS`.

### Confluences / filters mentioned
All cross-cutting filters apply (computed as `passes_<key>` flags on each trade row):
- `passes_macro_010` — by definition of the entry window, this is always True for v1 setups. (Useful when comparing against later expansions.)
- `passes_top3_macros`
- `passes_avoid_lunch`
- `passes_target_after_42`
- `passes_no_opposite_struct_h1`
- `passes_no_htf_rejection`
- `passes_aggressive_body`
- `passes_smt`

Plus a model-specific flag:
- `passes_pattern_inversion_fvg` — entry was via Inversion-FVG specifically (mentor's stated favorite).

### Open questions / ambiguities
1. **OB entry price exact location.** The mentor describes the OB but doesn't pin the entry to a specific price (open vs close vs midpoint of the OB candle). Source quote: "you would enter on the order block ... stop loss above this candle's low" (M1 PDF 55:10). For v1, conservative interpretation: entry = OB candle's open (worse fill, more realistic for a limit order).
2. **Pre-close entry.** Mentor describes positioning before H1 close (M1 PDF 21:25, M2 PDF 03:29). Engine v1 fires only at post-close; pre-close is deferred.
3. **OB swing-detection on M1.** Defining "the M1 swing high/low after pattern" requires picking a lookback. For v1, use the macro-window low/high (`min(M1[T:00..entry_ts].low)` for longs); revisit if results are noisy.
4. **Aggressive body threshold.** Mentor uses "aggressive" qualitatively. Initial: body ≥ 60% of range. To be parameter-swept.
5. **Opposite structure threshold.** Same — initial heuristic: a body-sized opposite wick on the H1 (wick on the *opposite* side ≥ 50% of the body) is "opposite structure." To be refined.
6. **HTF rejection definition.** Mentor uses H4 and daily liquidity. Initial: H1 close-direction wick takes out the recent H4 high/low (within last 24 H4 bars). To be refined.
7. **":42" exact semantics.** "High formed after :42" — is that the timestamp of the bar that contains the high price, the *bar's start* time, or the *bar's close*? For v1, use the start-time of the 1m bar that contains the H1's high price.

## Model: H1 Reversal

### Source citations
- Mentorship 1 PDF (summary) p.1 ("After H1 sweeps prior high and closes back inside range...")
- Mentorship 1 (1).pdf [transcript] 23:50, 38:30, 43:50 (mentor calls Reversal "best model in my opinion"), 44:13 (continuation reversal = bearish)
- Mentorship 2.pdf [transcript] 43:50–44:32, 35:54

### Plain-English description
After an H1 candle wicks past the prior H1's high (bearish reversal) or low (bullish reversal) but closes back inside the prior H1's range, the mentor expects the *opposite* extreme of the prior H1 to be the draw within the next H1 window. Same M1 trigger structure as Continuation, opposite direction logic.

### Anchor / setup timeframe
H1 (NY tz). Setup fires at H1 close at T.

### Detection rules (all must be true)
1. The just-closed H1 candle's wick swept the prior H1's range AND the close is back inside the prior H1's range:
   - Bearish reversal: `H1[T].high > H1[T-1h].high` AND `H1[T].close ≤ H1[T-1h].high`
   - Bullish reversal: `H1[T].low < H1[T-1h].low` AND `H1[T].close ≥ H1[T-1h].low`
2. The prior H1 exists.
3. The draw is the prior H1's *opposite* extreme:
   - Bearish reversal: target = `H1[T-1h].low`
   - Bullish reversal: target = `H1[T-1h].high`
4. M1 trigger criteria identical to Continuation (Order Block / Breaker / Inversion-FVG in the trade direction within `[T:00, T+0:10]`).
5. Risk gate: trigger's invalidation ≤ `MAX_RISK_PTS = 20.0`.

### Entry trigger / Stop loss / Take profit
Identical to Continuation, with mirrored direction.

### Direction logic
- Bearish reversal (high swept, close back inside) → short
- Bullish reversal (low swept, close back inside) → long

A single anchor produces at most one direction. (If both rules fire — e.g., close is exactly equal to a prior extreme — that's a degenerate case; tie-break: classify as Continuation if close strictly outside prior range, else Reversal.)

### Invalidation / discard
Same as Continuation.

### Confluences / filters
Same as Continuation, with the same `passes_<key>` flags.

### Open questions / ambiguities
1. **"Close back inside" — strict or weak inequality?** Mentor's language "close back inside the range" is ambiguous on whether `close == prior_high` counts. For v1, use weak inequality (`close ≤ prior_high` for bearish reversal, `close ≥ prior_low` for bullish reversal). I.e., closing exactly at the prior extreme is a reversal, not a continuation.
2. **Reversal vs Continuation tie-break.** Same anchor cannot produce both, by construction (close cannot simultaneously be strictly above prior high and ≤ prior high). But what if the H1 sweeps both prior high AND prior low (engulfing wicks)? Source is silent. For v1: classify by which side the close falls — if close > prior_high → Continuation bull; if close < prior_low → Continuation bear; if close inside range AND wick swept high → bearish reversal; if close inside range AND wick swept low → bullish reversal; if both wicks swept and close inside range → ambiguous, use **wick-magnitude tie-break**: assign to the side with the larger wick. This is the only rule the mentor doesn't directly specify; flagged as TBD.
3. **All other ambiguities** from Continuation (entry-price-on-OB, aggressive-body threshold, etc.) apply identically.

### Backtest results
_(filled in during Phase 4)_

## Phase 3 candidate
_(to be filled in Task 1.4 after all materials are read; current best guess: H1 Continuation, since Reversal has one more ambiguity (the rare two-sided sweep) and the mentor explicitly says to "master Continuation first.")_

### Plain-English description
2–4 sentences.

### Anchor / setup timeframe
e.g., "H1 candle that closes between 09:30 and 16:00 ET"

### Detection rules (all must be true)
1. Numbered list. Each rule is one boolean condition expressed in OHLC values, prior bars, time, or other models' state.
2. Vague terms are translated to a numeric threshold or flagged TBD with the source quote.

### Entry trigger
Exact bar/condition that fires the trade.

### Stop loss
Defined price relative to a specific bar's high/low.

### Take profit / exit
Either fixed R or a defined condition.

### Direction logic
How long vs short is determined.

### Invalidation / discard
When the setup is dropped before resolution.

### Confluences / filters mentioned
Each becomes a togglable dashboard chip, computed as a `passes_<key>: bool` flag on every trade row.

### Open questions / ambiguities
Numbered list with source quote.

### Backtest results (filled in during Phase 4)
- Baseline (no filters): WR, EV, PF, N, period
- With recommended filter combo: WR, EV, PF, N
- Notable regime breaks
- Walk-forward: train EV vs test EV, overfitting score
