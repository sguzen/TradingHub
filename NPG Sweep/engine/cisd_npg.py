"""npg-specification CISD: opposing-candle series broken by opposing close.

Mirrors the Pine source `detectCISDAndProjections` (sweep_cisd_mtf_fvg.pine
lines 658–723):

For a bearish setup (direction='SHORT'):
  - Walk BACKWARD from c2_idx collecting bullish candles (close > open)
  - Stop on the first bearish candle (close <= open) — no doji handling
  - Cap at max_series bars
  - Track series_high / series_low across the run (body if body_confirm else wick)
  - Walk FORWARD from c2_idx + 1: fire when close > series_high

For LONG: mirror — walk back collecting bearish, fire on close < series_low.

Returns None if no series + break is found within max_forward bars.
